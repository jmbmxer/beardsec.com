The Dreaded Todo List
================

One of my biggest productivity weaknesses in my past has been the dreaded todo list. I have tried software, stickie notes, sending myself emails, and just about anything else with no real luck.  In the end my tasks are not where they needed to be and I found myself having to dig into my memory or through a stack of stickie notes to remind myself of that one small task I put off for a few days. In comes the Bullet Journal method.

Keeping Organized
=====================

Link most interesting things I find on the internet, I stumbled across the Bullet Journal method on Hacker News and was immediately intrigued. I have always enjoyed the act of writing things down in a journal when traveling or brainstorming so the Bullet Journal method seemed like a perfect fit. I will not go into detail about the method but I do recommend checking it out <a href="www.bulletjournal.com">here</a>.

What Worked
=====================

<b>Accountability</b>
The premise of the Bullet Journal method is to make sure that all un-finished tasks are carried over to the next day. This was huge for me. The act of coming to the office every morning and having to write the same task from the day before gets old and serves as a constant reminder that I need to actually finish that task. After carrying over a task two or thee times I would finally just get it done on the spot. As a result of this I was able to get smaller tasks done that may have been swept under the rug using my previous task tracking methods.

<b>Forward Thinking</b>
I have my journal next to me at all times so I am able to plot out my next day's tasks with ease. I end each day by reviewing what I completed and move the incomplete tasks over to the next day so I can start fresh. When I arrive at the office I have a queue of unfinished tasks that I can add to and work from. Using the monthly calendar can also allow me to see what big events or tasks I have coming up that month.

<b>Physical Interaction</b>
Having one less application online to sign up for and become distracted by is what made the Bullet Journal really work for me. It separates my planning and task tracking from my already busy digital world and makes me mindfully think my tasks through and write them down. There is no copy and paste or "Remind me later" button. If I don't finish a task I have to write it again, and again..and again...



What Didn't Work
================
<b>Mobility</b>
Since I couldn't have the journal with me at all times it was difficult to make notes on the fly when I am not at the office or near the physical journal. I found myself resorting to the old send myself an email and put it in the journal the next morning or whenever I had access to the journal.

<b>Longer Term Tasks</b>
I have many tasks that could be classified as more of a "goal" as opposed to a todo task that needs done by a certain day. The Bullet Journal Method does not address these types of inputs so I decided to use the inside cover of my notebook for an ongoing list of goals and research projects that don't have a specific due date.

<b>My Own Procrastination</b>
This is by no fault of the Bullet Journal method but inherently, I procrastinate with certain things including writing in my journal. I would go 2 or 3 days without updating the task list and found myself needing to sit down and go through a back log and jot down everything that was completed and needed to be completed. This would happen with any task tracking mechanism in my opinion.

Keeping It Going
================
For now, I will be continuing to use the Bullet Journal method for my daily and monthly tasks.  With a few small personal tweaks the physical journal has become my work companion and I hope to fill many journals in the future on the road to GSD.
