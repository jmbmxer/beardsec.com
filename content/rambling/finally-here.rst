Well here it is.  I've been having a lot of security and technology things on my mind recently and figured I needed a new excuse to buy a ridiculous domain name, learn Hyde, and get to spend some quality time in my favorite editor, Sublime Text.  If you are reading this I assume you probably know me and what I do for a living. This blog is going to be an informal place for me to lay out some of my thoughts and experiments in application and network security as well as to document my ongoing journey to becoming a halfway decent developer.  I'll be talking about Python things, security ramblings, web development, and the occasional beard pun.  Thanks for tuning in.
