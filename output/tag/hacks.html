</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>A few months back I took the plunge into the pre-paid phone world with a very beat up iPhone 4 that was a freebie from a friend. After a few months, I was gifted a very mint 4S from my recently tech savvy parents. This upgrade forced a switch from StraightTalk (who uses the AT&amp;T network) to Ting mobile, a Sprint based cellular company.  In the process of getting the phone setup I ran into a massive glitch, the infamous iOS 7 Wi-Fi &quot;grey out&quot; issue.  Basically, for some reason the Wi-Fi chip thinks that it is overheated and disables its functionality, making it impossible to reliably join and stay connected to any Wi-Fi network. This was a deal breaker for me and since I already scrapped the old phone for parts, I needed to figure out a solution. After scouring Apple discussion boards and searching around I discovered a Canadian blog post about overheating your phone on purpose then cooling it down quickly which restores the wireless chip back to its operational state.</p>
<p>This sounds wacky, but I was desperate. I grabbed a hair drier, cranked it up, and pointed it near the Wi-Fi chip. After about 6 minutes or so, the phone gave me a warning that the phone needs to cool down.</p>

<p>Voila! I successfully overheated my brand new phone. From what I gather, this sends a hard reset to the Wi-Fi chip bringing it back to its non-buggy state and brings the Wi-Fi back to a normal operating state.  I did put the phone in the refrigerator after for a bit to bring it back to life but I don't think this is totally necessary.</p>
<p>It's been a few weeks now and things are running without a hitch. I am in and out of 3 or 4 networks a day and have not run into any issues.  Anyone dealing with the horrid Wi-Fi issue that iOS 7 presents to some phones, give this a shot. What else do you have to lose?</p>
