I've been having a lot of things on my mind as of late and figured I needed a new excuse to buy a ridiculous domain name, learn Hyde, and get to spend some quality time in my favorite editor, Sublime Text.  If you are reading this I assume you probably know me and what I do for a living. This blog is going to reflect some of my thoughts and experiments in application security and document my ongoing journey to becoming a halfway decent developer.  I'll be talking about Python things, security ramblings, web development , and the occasional beard pun.  Thanks for tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
