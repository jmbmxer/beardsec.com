After a few months, I was gifted a very mint 4S from my recently tech savvy parents. This upgrade forced a switch from StraightTalk (who uses the AT&amp;amp;T network) to Ting mobile, a Sprint based cellular company.  In the process of getting the phone setup I ran into a massive glitch, the infamous iOS 7 Wi-Fi &amp;quot;grey out&amp;quot; issue.  Basically, for some reason the Wi-Fi chip thinks that it is overheated and disables its functionality, making it impossible to reliably join and stay connected to any Wi-Fi network. This was a deal breaker for me and since I already scrapped the old phone for parts, I needed to figure out a solution. After scouring Apple discussion boards and searching around I discovered a Canadian blog post about overheating your phone on purpose then cooling it down quickly which restores the wireless chip back to its operational state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds wacky, but I was desperate. I grabbed a hair drier, cranked it up, and pointed it near the Wi-Fi chip. After about 6 minutes or so, the phone gave me a warning that the phone needs to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! I successfully overheated my brand new phone. From what I gather, this sends a hard reset to the Wi-Fi chip bringing it back to its non-buggy state and brings the Wi-Fi back to a normal operating state.  I did put the phone in the refrigerator after for a bit to bring it back to life but I don't think this is totally necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a few weeks now and things are running without a hitch. I am in and out of 3 or 4 networks a day and have not run into any issues.  Anyone dealing with the horrid Wi-Fi issue that iOS 7 presents to some phones, give this a shot. What else do you have to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

I've been having a lot of security and technology things on my mind recently and figured I needed a new excuse to buy a ridiculous domain name, learn Hyde, and get to spend some quality time in my favorite editor, Sublime Text.  If you are reading this I assume you probably know me and what I do for a living. This blog is going to be an informal place for me to lay out some of my thoughts and experiments in application and network security as well as to document my ongoing journey to becoming a halfway decent developer.  I'll be talking about Python things, security ramblings, web development, and the occasional beard pun.  Thanks for tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
